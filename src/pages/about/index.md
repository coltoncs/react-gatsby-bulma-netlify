I built this website as a way to give myself hands-on learning with web development, while also learning the barebones in school and working towards my degree. Everything on this website was put together by myself in my spare time outside of learning at Wake Tech and working at Progress Software.

_This website was built with React under the Gatsby framework. It is hosted on Netlify and uses Netlify's CMS for content management. For more information, be sure to read my blog post on the creation and maintenance of this site._



## A brief introduction

My name is Colton Sweeney, and I enjoy many things; among them is web development. 



From a very young age, I've had an affinity for computers and how they work. At 5 years old I was playing around with simple image editors to create pictures. When I was 10 I began learning audio and video production with tools such as Ableton Live Studio and Adobe AfterEffects. By the time I was 16, I was dabbling in the world of novice programming and creating one-off scripts with Python and scraping web pages. 



This attraction evolved until I was 18 and working my first job outside of high school as a Product Marketing Intern at Progress Software. Here, I was given the opportunity to experiment with more advanced technologies and soon learned became enthralled with the world of web development. I switched my Computer Engineering degree to a Web Developer degree (albeit a bit late in the process) and haven't looked back since.



## What is my technological background?

As evidenced in the previous section, I have a wide range of experience when it comes to technology. I have over a decade of experience with image manipulation software such as Adobe Photoshop, some minor experience with audio and music production with software such as Ableton Live and FL Studio, and extensive experience with programming technologies.
