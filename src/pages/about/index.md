I built this website as a way to give myself hands-on learning with web development, while also learning the barebones in school and working towards my degree. Everything on this website was put together by myself in my spare time outside of learning at Wake Tech and working at Progress Software & URECO more recently.

_This website was built with React under the Gatsby framework. It is hosted on Netlify and uses Netlify's CMS for content management. For more information, be sure to read my blog post on the creation and maintenance of this site._
