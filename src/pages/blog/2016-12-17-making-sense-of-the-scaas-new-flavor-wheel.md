Hello there, thank you for visiting my website! I'm excited for the progress that will be made here as I further my knowledge of web development as a whole. For those of you who don't know who I am, my name is Colton Sweeney and I'm a student and intern working in Raleigh, NC.

## What the Hell Do I Do?

I'm currently enrolled at the local Wake Technical Community College studying for an Associates in Web Development. I also work part-time at Progress Software where I work on the Core A Product Marketing Team. In fact, [here's a few](https://youtu.be/iKdiLrqNMTM?t=52) of my awesome co-workers and I from a few years ago! Core A consists of products such as Sitefinity (an enterprise .NET CMS) and Digital Experience Cloud, a cloud-serviced user experience management software for driving dynamic UX's. With the PMK team, I really don't have strictly documented responsibilities. Whenever someone needs help with something technical, I'm usually the one to help. Below are a few things I've done in my 3 years with Progress.

* Update core product seller pages. This includes collecting articles from ContentGem, compiling reviews from TrustRadius, and updating events info in some cases.
* Write blog posts and create infographics and whitepapers for Sitefinity & DEC products. Some blog posts that I've written for Sitefinity can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colton-sweeney/detail/recent-activity/posts/).
* Perform mundane spreadsheet and word processing tasks.
* Work with colleagues around the globe on different projects, such as marketing campaigns and product content.
* On one special occasion, I coded a custom Alexa chatbot experience that was used in a Partner trade show demonstration! 

Of course I've done more in my time there, however those are just a few of the tasks I've taken on.

## What the updates mean to you

The Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA), founded in 1982, is a non-profit trade organization for the specialty coffee industry. With members located in more than 40 countries, SCAA represents every segment of the specialty coffee industry, including:

* producers
* roasters
* importers/exporters
* retailers
* manufacturers
* baristas

For over 30 years, SCAA has been dedicated to creating a vibrant specialty coffee community by recognizing, developing and promoting specialty coffee. SCAA sets and maintains quality standards for the industry, conducts market research, and provides education, training, resources, and business services for its members.

Coffee cupping, or coffee tasting, is the practice of observing the tastes and aromas of brewed coffee. It is a professional practice but can be done informally by anyone or by professionals known as "Q Graders". A standard coffee cupping procedure involves deeply sniffing the coffee, then loudly slurping the coffee so it spreads to the back of the tongue.

The coffee taster attempts to measure aspects of the coffee's taste, specifically the body (the texture or mouthfeel, such as oiliness), sweetness, acidity (a sharp and tangy feeling, like when biting into an orange), flavour (the characters in the cup), and aftertaste. Since coffee beans embody telltale flavours from the region where they were grown, cuppers may attempt to identify the coffee's origin.
