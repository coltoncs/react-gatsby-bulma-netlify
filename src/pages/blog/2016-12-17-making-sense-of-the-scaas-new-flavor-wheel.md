Hi, thank you for visiting my website! Content is still being developed here, so stick with me while I keep updating it all.

## What Do I Do?

I'm currently enrolled at the local Wake Technical Community College studying for an Associates in Web Development. I also work part-time at Progress Software where I work on the Core A Product Marketing Team. Core A consists of products such as Sitefinity CMS and Digital Experience Cloud, OpenEdge IDE, and more. With the PMK team, I really don't have strictly documented responsibilities. Whenever someone needs help with something technical, I'm usually the one to help. Below are a few things I've done in my 3 years with Progress.

* Update core product seller pages. This includes collecting articles from ContentGem, compiling reviews from TrustRadius, and updating events info in some cases.
* Write blog posts and create infographics and whitepapers for Sitefinity & DEC products. Some blog posts that I've written for Sitefinity can be found [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colton-sweeney/detail/recent-activity/posts/).
* Work with colleagues around the globe on different projects, such as marketing campaigns and product content.
* On one special occasion, I coded a custom Alexa chatbot experience that was used in a Partner trade show demonstration! 

Of course I've done more in my time there, however those are just a few of the tasks I've taken on. I have a wide range of skills besides those when it comes to computers. For instance, I can:

* Utilize full Microsoft Office Suite for tools such as content management, smart spreadsheets, and more.
* Work with Adobe Creative Cloud on wide range of programs for tasks such as image manipulation, color grading, vector manipulation, video effects and editing, UI & UX development, audio mixing & mastering, and more.
