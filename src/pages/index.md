        I've been interested in software and web development for a number of
        years. In my beginner period, I learned how to program with websites
        like Udemy and Code Academy, while following practical tutorials to get
        hands-on experience.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
