    Hi, my name is Colton Sweeney and I'm a 21-year-old web developer and
    graphic designer living in Raleigh, NC.

  Hello! I'm a full-time student working for a degree in Web Development, as
  well as a part-time intern working at a local enterprise software company.
  Things that make me tick include cars, cats, coffee, and most importantly --
  computers.

        I can help with a variety of coding needs, whether you need a custom
        bot  implemented with your Smart Home tech, or a full-serviced website
        with  all the bells and whistles, I'd be happy to help. I have
        experience with  languages such as Java, C#, Python and frameworks such
        as Django, Express,  and ASP.NET. I love playing around in JavaScript
        libraries, as well. As a  matter of fact, this website was built using
        React and Gatsby!

        I'm also experienced with the hardware side of computers. I have
        experience building powerful desktops and small form IoT boards for a
        variety of tasks. For desktops, I can create builds ranging in size and
        complexity. Whether you're looking for a water-cooled workstation that
        can fit in your backpack or a personal browsing machine or media server
        that can fit in your hand, I can build and program them.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
        Email us or call the store for details.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
