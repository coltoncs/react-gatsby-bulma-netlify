  This is a small, single page React application that I built using
  create-react-app. It is very lightweight, existing as a client-side React app
  that's deployed to a Heroku instance.

I built this app to familiarize myself with data fetching in React with the Hooks API. I use useState for state functionality inside the function-based components, and use onKeyPress commands to retrieve the city from the search box and return the query from Open Weather Map's online API. I retrieve a few pieces of information and display them in the app. 

The app is responsive by use of CSS media queries and fits phones, tablets, and desktops nicely. In the future I plan to build out the application with animations, stricter styling, and more. For the time being it works as a showcase for my React and CSS abilities
