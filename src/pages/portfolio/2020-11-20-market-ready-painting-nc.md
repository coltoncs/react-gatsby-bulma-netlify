  I created this website for Market Ready Painting NC. Previously hosted on
  Squarespace, MRP was paying nearly $220 a year for an outdated web presence.
  Many design elements of the old website did not fit in with the bigger picture
  of the business, and some elements drew attention away from the more important
  aspects of the site.
