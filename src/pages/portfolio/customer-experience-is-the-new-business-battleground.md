In my early days at Progress, I was frequently tasked with creating whitepapers and other technical documents for our Sitefinity product. This was one of many whitepapers that I published titled "Customer Experience is the New Business Battleground." The whitepaper itself is an interesting read and provides some interesting insight into the state of customer experience when it comes to content management.
