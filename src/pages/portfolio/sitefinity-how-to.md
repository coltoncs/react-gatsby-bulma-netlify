After my original app development project at Progress came to an end, I was tasked with a series of different projects that focused more on Marketing efforts for the Sitefinity CMS product. Of these projects, was one in which I created and published a three-part How-To series for Sitefinity.

The three tutorials were aimed at using the Sitefinity CMS backend for a variety of tasks. These included customizing text boxes, navigation, and creating custom widgets! The tutorials were aimed at the more technical users of the Sitefinity software, but are simple enough for pretty much anyone to follow along,

In all, I thought the project was a great way of learning the Sitefinity interface and gaining a little bit of professional exposure. By the end of the project, I had:

* Identified three areas where users of Sitefinity could benefit from tutorials.
* Drafted three tutorial posts with in-depth instructions on how to achieve the given task.
* Worked with editorial teams to create a final version of the tutorials.
* Posted tutorials to LinkedIn, Twitter, etc. and promoted on the official Progress social media!

At the end of the project, I ended up enjoying the work much more than I had originally anticipated. I was confident in my abilities to work with the CMS stack and promote social media content, and felt the project had given me valuable experience.
